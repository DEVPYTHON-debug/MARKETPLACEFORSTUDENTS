Tagline:

Connecting Students with Local Services – Seamlessly and Intelligently

Overview:

Si-link App is a dynamic mobile and web application that bridges the gap between students and local service providers. Imagine Amazon's product-based browsing, Fiverr's gig-based engagement, and Facebook's social interaction — all in one platform. With Si-link, students can discover services, explore virtual shops, engage providers in real-time chat, post and promote their own gigs, and enjoy a community-driven marketplace backed by a secure and intelligent system.

 🎯 Goal: Build a stunning, dark-themed mobile dashboard for the "Si-link" app using the **glowing, high-contrast neon UI style** (like in a crystal ball with shiny orange, blue, and yellow reflections over dark surfaces).  👤 Target Users: - Students (Customers) - Service Providers (Vendors) - Virtual Assistants (AI Bots)  🛠 Tech Stack: - **React Native** (Expo or bare) - **Tailwind CSS** (via Nativewind or styled-components) - **Icons:** Tabler Icons or Lucide - **Backend:** Supabase (auth, DB, real-time, edge functions) - **Payment Gateway:** Flutterwave  🎨 UI Style Reference: - Reflective glow effects (orange/yellow/blue over black) - Rounded, neon-stroked cards and buttons - Smooth gradients, luminous highlights - Inspired by this orb aesthetic: [Describe or attach your image here]  📲 What to Build: Build the **main dashboard UI screen** with the following sections: 1. 🔒 Authenticated User Info + Profile Icon (top-right) 2. 💰 Wallet Balance (big glowing card) 3. 📊 Income & Expenses (two side-by-side glowing buttons) 4. 📉 View Report Button (animated on press) 5. 🧾 Recent Transactions Preview (scrollable or list with shimmer effects) 6. 🛍️ Quick Links: "My Shop", "Post a Gig", "Browse Services" 7. 🔔 Notification badge for unread messages or orders  💬 Notes: - Use **dark background (#000)** with blue/orange glow. - Use **linear gradients**, **neon edges**, and **soft shadows**. - Use **animated press states** and ripple glow effects on tap. - **Responsive for Android/iOS**.  🔥 Bonus (if possible): - Add shimmer loading effect - Use SVG glow filters or Lottie for floating orb effect - Include dummy transaction cards (avatar, amount, timestamp)  📌 Final Deliverable: A complete `Dashboard.js` React Native screen styled with Tailwind or equivalent CSS-in-JS solution. Add mock data and animations and also dont forget to prepare it for production . Keep the code modular.
